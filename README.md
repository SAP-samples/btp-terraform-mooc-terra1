# Getting Started with Terraform on SAP BTP

## Description

This repository contains the code samples used throughout the course "Getting Started with Terraform on SAP BTP".

## Prerequisites

There are some requirements you must fulfill before being able to start with the coding exercises using the Terraform provider for SAP BTP. The prerequisites are:

- You have an SAP BTP Trial Account. If you don't have one yet, you can get one [here](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html).
- Make sure that your SAP Universal ID is configured correctly. You can find the instructions in [SAP Note 3085908](https://me.sap.com/notes/3085908).
- The Terraform provider does not support 2FA. Make sure that this option is not enforced for your account.

Depending on the setup described in [unit 1 lesson 3](./units/unit_1/lesson_3/README.md) further prerequisites are required:

- If you intend to use the [recommended 'dev container' tools option](./units/unit_1/lesson_3/README.md) you must have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) including the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed on your machine.
- You want to use A GitHub Codespace you must have a GitHub user. If you don't have one, [sign-up on GitHub](https://github.com/signup).
